This will be my second project (outside of my prework) before beginning my bootcamp at Flatiron School (Aug 29 2022). In this project I will create a slider that will display images and gives the user the ability to toggle between images. I will be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And of course, I will be using my favorite resource, google. :)
